fold the following RNA sequence with Nussinov Algorithm:
gggaaatcc
length of RNA sequence = 9
using the following parameters:
l_min =  1
alpha(G,C) = alpha(C,G) = -1
alpha(A,U) = alpha(U,A) = -1
alpha(G,U) = alpha(U,G) = -1
all other alpha values have been set to infinity
score: -3
result:
(2,9)(3,8)(5,7)
