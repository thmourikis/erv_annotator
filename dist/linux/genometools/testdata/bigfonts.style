--[[
  This is the GenomeTools annotation viewer config file.
  All options must be set inside the 'style' table.
  All items in this table must be tables, called 'sections'.
  Typically there is one section per feature type.

  Color definitions
  -----------------
  Colors are given as RGB triplets
       {red=<val>,green=<val>,blue=<val>(,alpha=<val>)}
  where <val> is a decimal value between 0 and 1.
  The alpha value is optional, as a default 0.5 will be used.

  Global format settings
  ----------------------
  Global settings, such as margins, spacers, etc. are found at the end of this
  file, in the "format" section.
