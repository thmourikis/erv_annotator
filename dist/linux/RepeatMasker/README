Updates of the RepeatMasker program are distributed with a copy of the
Dfam database ( www.dfam.org ).  Currently this is a human-only database 
for use with the new HMMER 3.x nhmmer program.  The full RepeatMasker 
consensus database falls under the copy rights of the Genetic Information 
Research Institute and are available at its website 
    http://www.girinst.org/server/RepBase/RepBase.rptmsk.tar.gz

We maintain these libraries as co-editor of RepBase Update and aim to
keep them in sync with the RepBase Update libraries.  However, at any
one time there are differences.  Entries can differ somewhat in
sequence, generally not by more than a few percent.  The nomenclature
is by and large identical. Discrepant RepBase and RepeatMasker names
for identical sequences are indicated in the EMBL formatted version of
the RepeatMasker database.

An inevitable origin of differences is RepeatMasker's extensive
post-alignment processing (improvement) of the repeat annotation. For
one of many examples, internal sequences of LTR elements can be named
after the LTRs, even if there is no specific entry for that element in
the databases. The new alignment file format ( 4.0 and higher ) displays
the actual consensus sequence identifier and a ID to cross-reference to
the final annotation in the *.out file.

The script queryRepeatDatabase.pl in the utilities directory
( RepeatMasker/util/ ) will display how many repeats are in the library
for a given species. For poorly-covered species, you can create your
own libraries and use these with RepeatMasker. Alternatively, you can
mask your sequence using our transposon-protein database at
http://www.repeatmasker.org/cgi-bin/RepeatProteinMaskRequest. We will 
make the protein-masking program and database part of the downloaded
RepeatMasker package in the near future.
