Installation 
------------

  1. Unpack the files to the directory you wish to install
     them in.

  2. Configure the distribution by invoking Perl on the
     the "configure" script, i.e.:
  
            perl ./configure

     The configure script will prompt you for all the
     information needed to setup the RepeatMasker suite of
     programs.


Library Cache Directories
-------------------------

Since version 3.0 RepeatMasker creates species-specific libraries
on the fly.  These libraries are cached in the first writable 
directory in the programs library path.  The default path is:

  1. The RepeatMasker installation "Library" directory.
  2. The ".RepeatMaskerCache" subdirectory of the users home
     directory.
  3. The temporary processing directory "RM_#" created
     in the same directory as the sequence file and 
     removed at the end of the run.
  
NOTE: If the program cannot save libraries in either path 1 or 2, the
libraries will need to be created each time the program runs.  This
will slow down runs on shorter sequences.
